You have a list of lists of integers.  Each list of integers is sorted.
Example:
data = [[1,5],[2,5,5,9],[6,8,12]]
Write a datastructure that has a function ".next()"  which returns the next lowest number which had not previously been returned.

in this case:
foo.next() -> 1
foo.next() -> 2
foo.next() -> 5
foo.next() -> 5
foo.next() -> 5
foo.next() -> 6

and so on.
Limitations:
The lists may be very large so you can't copy the entire data structure.
You can't alter the data in place (you can't remove items or re-order them).
